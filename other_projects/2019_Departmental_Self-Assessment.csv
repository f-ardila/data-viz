Input from this process feeds into a PAR-based committee process to construction an action plan. The department chair takes responsibility for implementation of the plan, with progress monitored by the equity and inclusion committee. The plan and its implementation status are shared with external assessment bodies",I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"Four thoughts:

1) The standards for any particular level and question are very detailed and specific.  I have no way of knowing whether our department actually does everything that is mentioned for a particular level, or even whether the exact combination of activities given would be ideal.  Instead, I took these lists of benchmarks as ILLUSTRATIVE of a developmental scale, and I tried to gauge where in our thinking and practices our department might sit along such a scale.

2) I think that the standards put forward to attain the Transforming level are in most cases very time-consuming and beyond the abilities of a poor state-funded organization like ours to support.  I am worried that expecting this level of performance will further exacerbate the gap between the have and have-not institutions and will in some sense retard rather than incentivize forward progress.  Are we talking directly to the AAS experts?  If we are, then it would be good to sit down with them to sketch out staffing and implementation plans for a number of these items in order to know how much time and effort they actually require.

3) After the manpower and support requirements are better understood (from Item 2), can we bring the assessment and its results to the attention of the Dean to initiate a discussion of implementation priorities and strategy, perhaps to include some needed increase in staffing and budget?

4) Is there any way of bringing this effort to the attention of the Physics department?"
